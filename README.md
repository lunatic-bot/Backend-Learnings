# Backend Learnings

Welcome to my Backend Learnings Repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning Python backend development, focusing on **FastAPI**. Here, you'll find a collection of code samples, projects, and notes that I've accumulated as I dive deeper into the world of backend development. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your skills, I hope you find this repository helpful!


## ðŸ“– Introduction

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It offers a simple yet powerful way to build web applications and APIs, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers. This repository serves as a personal learning journal where I track my progress, experiment with new concepts, and build projects using FastAPI.
