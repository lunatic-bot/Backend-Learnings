# SQLAlchemy Learnings

Welcome to my **SQLAlchemy Learnings** Repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in mastering **SQLAlchemy** with Python. You will find code samples, projects, and notes that reflect my progress in understanding and using SQLAlchemy for database management and integration in backend development. If you're interested in deepening your knowledge of databases in Python, I hope you find this repository useful and insightful!

## ðŸ“– Introduction

**SQLAlchemy** is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access. This repository focuses on various SQLAlchemy features, patterns, and best practices to help streamline database operations in Python projects.

Through these learnings, I also aim to explore the integration of SQLAlchemy with Python web frameworks such as FastAPI, allowing for seamless database management in modern backend applications.
